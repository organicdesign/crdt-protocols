# crdt-protocols

Protocols for encoding and decoding CRDT data. This only contains definitions for the specific types of crdts, for example a string set. Generic types need to be done through CBOR. Currently the only useful defnition here is the synchronizer protocol, the rest are only definitions for old attempts at generic types.
